# GCPCollectoinMap
Space to coordinate work to show GCP collections on a map.   the script will crawl through a directory, find the coordinates, and display on a graph / map

The script will crawl through the <project_folder>/02_collection/06_Check_In Exports directory and look for each .csv
Then grab the time from the file, and the lat long of the point.  (we would need to figure out the date for the point some how)
And Plot those points on a Map.  (graph) - I have a good article on plotting maps in python.
 
the map will show each point collected.
 
add-ons:
we could show the chipping plan
and animate the collection over time...
